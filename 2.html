<h2>WOMEN</h2>
<p>A woman is an adult female human.[1][2] The term woman may also refer to a girl (a female child or adolescent). The plural women is sometimes used for female humans regardless of age, as in phrases such as "women's rights."

Typically, a woman has two X chromosomes and is capable of pregnancy and giving birth from puberty until menopause. Female anatomy, as distinguished from male anatomy, includes the fallopian tubes, ovaries, uterus, vulva, breasts, Skene's glands, and Bartholin's glands. The adult female pelvis is wider than the male's, the hips are generally broader, and women have significantly less facial and other body hair. On average, women are shorter and less muscular than men.
